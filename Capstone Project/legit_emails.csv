Outta here ,"Hey Richard,
I got nailed on Friday and will be working out of my home. Belden has both copies of the CD ROM. I mentioned that you would be getting in touch with him to have him send it to you, assuming you are still with the company. Let me know what's up with you.

 ,"Kenron's business is to create value and opportunity
for its senior management. We 
do this by combining our employees' personal financial
resources and restricting the 
flow of information to the market  to create
innovative accountancy solutions to 
challenge the US financial regulations. We are best
known for our lack of respect 
and truthfulness and single minded ambition to stray
from our core competencies of 
natural gas and electricity products into all kinds of
unprofitable markets and hair 
brained ventures. 

Today we offer vast diversified product range, 
including office space in many major 
US and European cities, second hand computer
equipment, and useless IT Helpdesk 
promotional gimmickry. In fact we have the largest
stock of nearly new Compaq and 
Sun computers in the world. These products give
customers the flexibility they need 
to lose all their money and achieve into the highly
sought after status of suing our ass 
in a class action. 

It's difficult to define Kenron in a sentence, but our
senior executives have been 
described as ""incompetent"", ""arrogant"" and "" a bunch
of thieving bustards"" by many 
top tier financial institutions. We falsify commodity
markets so that we can deliver 
physical commodities to our customers at a
ridiculously unsustainable price. It's 
difficult, too, to talk about Kenron without using the
word ""screwed."" Most of the things 
we do have never been done before, like going from a
market capitalisation of 
nearly $90 billion to $199 in the space of a year!!!!
We believe in the economic 
benefits of secret, underhanded insider trading, and
we play a leading role in ripping 
off our investors. We initiated the  wholesale
bandwidth markets in the United States, 
and we are helping to build similar markets in Europe
and elsewhere. Shame we 
lost billions in doing so :-( 

Every day we strive to hype up our share price to
unrealistic highs, with the sole 
purpose of suckering the investor community and lining
our own pockets. Our passion 
has enabled us to completely mismanage risk. No wonder
Misfortune Magazine 
surveys have named Kenron the most innovative company
in America for six years in 
a row. Our emloyees think Kenron is such a wonderful
place to work, thousands are 
leaving every day to spread the word around the world.


Knron's four business units  Wholesale Services,
Energy Services, Broadband 
Services and Transportation Services  ARE NOW

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:

school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic

application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business

IT Update: security of Revenue-Producing Systems ,"In our continuing effort to provide security and stability to the revenue-producing systems here at EES, we would like to ask for your assistance with a few items.  In general, we want to ensure that all business critical systems are clear from the risk of downtime, which could negatively impact the business.

So, what does this mean to you?  We need to make sure that any computer programs and files you use to do your job are protected and reside in an environment that is controlled by the IT infrastructure group.  This serves several purposes, including:

Ensuring that everything business critical is backed up properly and can be recovered if a workstation's hard drive fails.
Ensuring that specialized programs like Cobra or BSOC or RPS or RGS which are business critical can easily be installed on any workstation by the IT group.  This will help keep the business up and running if you have to switch workstations suddenly.

Specialized applications - If you use any special program to do your work, such as WinAT or some other database, analysis, or special utility tool, the IT infrastructure group should be made aware of it so that they can learn how to install and maintain it.  This way, if an elephant sneaks into the office one night and steps on your computer, we can build out another workstation, install the specialized programs on it for you, and deliver it to you so that you can continue to do your job.  Please contact Christine Nguyen at (713) 345-8459 if you think your computer application is not currently maintained by IT.

Files: Spreadsheets, Excel macros, MS Access databases, and the like - Please make sure that any spreadsheets or MS Access databases you use for the business are not stored on your local computer drives.  These files should be stored on a network-shared drive (in general, something other than C or D drive).  That way, if that elephant comes back another night, we could get you another workstation from which to operate without losing any of your valuable work.

Web sites - If you are responsible for maintaining a web site that is business critical, including those used by inside as well as outside customers, we need to make sure that this web site is hosted on one of the fault-tolerant redundant web servers provided by IT infrastructure, and not running on a laptop tucked away under your desk.  This will help keep the web site available to those who need it in the event of power outages, server failures, and other unforeseen hardware-related problems.  Please contact Larry Hack at (713) 345-5783 if you think your web site is not currently maintained by IT.

Your support with this effort is greatly appreciated."

-	talented
-	creative
-     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
-	innovative spirit
-   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
-   ability to embrace change
-   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
-	pay and benefits
-   true meritocracy
-   unlimited opportunities



The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
-	A decline in the overall market and economy;
-   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
-   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
-   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
-   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
-	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
-	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
-	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
-    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
-   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
-   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
-	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
-	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
-	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
-	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
-	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
-	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
-   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world."

FTRs Allocation ,"Hi richard,
can you find out or have michele find out as much as we can about obtaining FTRs and the various issues regarding that with regards to.. time lines and logistics and our rights as LSEs.
It is becoming more and more apparent that we could save a lot of money by physically serving the load that we have in PJM if we get FTRs allocated to us. As a part of the new auction that the Jersey utilities are having we might be able to get some things done that might not have been possible as an LSE  like getting FTRs from locations that we choose and such
I would like to see if we can start puting pressure on them next weekif we can get our information gathering done this week then we will be in shape to meet with our govt affairs people maybe next week.. if we have to.
Also as a side note any information on how we can request capacity for the transmission that we requested 15 to 20 days ago for 2004???

thanks."

Financial to Physical Switching ,"I wanted to give all of you an update on the process of switching accounts from financial to physical, and a data collection effort to provide necessary information to facilitate this process.

Financial to Physical Switching

I will be working with Operations and Services Managment to better define this process over the next couple of weeks, in the meantime, here is the interim process:

Develop a list of accounts that are currently being served financially that you want to switch to physical service.  Include at least the account name, account number, and utility name.  Please screen the utility name to make sure that we are capable of physically serving that utility within the next 45 days.  Be aware that customer contractual obligations or utilty tariff rules may substantially delay our ability to serve the customer physically.
Send this list of accounts to David Salley in Services Management, copy me and Scott Massey on the email.
David will review the accounts for contractual obligations and other necessary information and forward to Jay Bhatty in Operations.
Jay will perform the necessary steps to send the request to CSC.
CSC will create the DASR (Direct Access Service Request) and send it to the appropriate utility to initiate the switch to physical.

Customer Data Collection Project

I have asked Services Management to undertake a data collection process on all our existing accounts.  Scott Massey is responsible for this effort.  The primary purpose of this it to identify all of our accounts and to have enough information to make economic decisions on switching customers from financial to physical.  This data collection project has been combined with a P&L project begun in Illinois.  The attachment below describes this project in more detail and includes the data to be collected.

Please copy me on any further requests for existing customer data so that we can eliminate duplicate requests.

Thanks,

 RE: BGE Index Product - Change to LMP BGE Zone Index ,"Narsimha,

Good point, and the key is that BGE's standard offer includes a $7 ""retail adder"" to the market-based price.  This retail adder was part of BGE's settlement agreement.  To the extent all of our deal costs (including a scheduling fee) and origination margin are notably less than $7, then customers will be better off under our index product.

Bob"
 RE: BGE Index Product - Change to LMP BGE Zone Index ,"fyiThere is a scheduling fee that needs to be added to the deal costsand just for my curiosity what is the reason why the customer would switch to us instead of staying with the incumbent utility with this product??? isn't this exactly the SO product being offered by the utility without the origination margin???
-narsimha"
 RE: BGE Index Product - Change to LMP BGE Zone Index ,"Narsimha Michele,

Thanks for helping us with this index product issue.

We were initially planning to use an East Hub index with a basis of all uplifts, but Gillian and I agree with you on the advantages of using an index of PJM LMP zonal prices including all uplifts.  The product will certainly be more comparable to BGE's standard offer pricing, and it will eliminate the basis risk that you would have had with the East Hub index product.  A BGE zone index product will also eliminate the price comparison issues we had due to congestion.  

Based on today's discussion we will modify the design of the BGE index product proposal to reflect a pass-through of LMP BGE zone prices and uplifts.  The basis for this product would simply be deal costs and origination margin.

Gillian and I will work with Berney's group on changes to the TC, and a modified Product Approval Template will be routed soon.

Thanks again,
Bob"

The only answer to a mission invite ,"This is the cold-hard truth of working in intel – most people will never get invited in.

 

Nothing disappoints me more than when people get that rare, once in a lifetime invitation and don’t recognize how special it is.

 

Recently, I got a call from a private intel client in Las Vegas who had an immediate need for new static surveillance team members.

 

The job was short-notice but a total 'unicorn' opportunity; all expenses paid including lodging in a major Las Vegas strip hotel/casino, $500/day base pay + $100 for incidentals, a pre-brief and turnover with other surveillance members currently in Vegas.

 

And the client openly admitted he would need continued support for the next 90-120 days!

 

So far the story is good, right? Well, now it gets less good…

 

I spent my afternoon tapping my network to find potential candidates for this awesome entry-level private intel invitation. 

 

By the end of the day, I had a list of 11 people who had expressed interest.

 

But I found out quickly they didn’t understand how special (or rare) the invite was.

 

The client held a zoom call for all 11 folks, gave them the breakdown, promised them a fun and easy contract, and personally invited them to come out to Vegas.

 

The client told each person they could set their own contract start/end date and that they could take up to 7 days to get personal life organized before coming out. 

 

This kind of offer is incredibly rare in intel  both private and government!

 

Of the 11 people who said they were interested, took time with the client, got all the op details, and were handed a golden invitation, only 2 accepted.

 

Here is what the others had to say:

 

“Hey Andrew. I’m not able to make the logistics for this one work. Feel free to reach out in the future if you’re in need.” - Richie

 

Nope. Not gonna happen, Richie What I need is people different from you.

 

“Hi Andrew. I think I would love to do this but personally I just would need more confidence with the situation.” - Crystal

 

Your confidence is not my problem, Crystal. You will not be getting a second offer.

 

“I am interested, but I won’t be ready by next week…” - Justin

 

Then you will never be ready, Justin. Keep your day job.

 

“I’m going to have to pass on this due to family stuff… and I look forward to more opportunities!” - Paul

 

No, Paul. You’re ‘looking forward’ and seeing more family stuff. Not opportunities.

 

“Mr. Bustamante, Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to come out on this one. Hopefully, the next time the opportunity comes up I’ll be able to help out.” - Joe

 

Fortunately for me, I won’t be wasting any more of my own time talking to you, Joe.

 

The intel world is inconvenient, impatient, and unforgiving; full of action-makers and risk-takers who let nothing stand in their way.

 

That’s why I sound unreasonable. 

 

Because there is no such thing as ‘reasonable’ in the world of real, life-changing opportunities.

 

Here is what the 2 that accepted the contract said:

 

“It sounds perfect, although I’m supposed to be going on spring break… I’m pretty sure I can finagle 5 days and get there by Friday night.” - CODENAME: EDCHARGER

 

“I’m working to free my schedule next week… I can fly out as early as Tuesday night.” - CODENAME: INVICTUS

 

When you get an invitation like these 11 people, recognize it for what it is.

 

You don’t have to be interested in intel. 

 

You don’t have to like me or hate your current job. 

 

And you don’t have to say ‘yes’ if you don’t want to

 

But you have to realize that you will not be given a second chance.

 

So make sure you know that when you say ‘not this time’ what you’re actually saying is ‘not ever.’

 

I’m on a train, and it’s not slowing down. 

 

For those of you that are right next to me, I love that you’re here. Now we’re really starting to gain speed! 

 

Buckle up, or get off.
